# Advanced Linear Algebra

## Overview

This repository contains Python implementations of key concepts in **linear algebra** with a focus on computation and practical understanding. The project provides functions and tutorials to perform matrix operations, calculate determinants, inverses, and explore eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and matrix definiteness.

## Concepts Covered

### Determinant
- Calculation of the determinant of a square matrix.
- Handling of special cases, such as the 0Ã—0 matrix.
- Error handling for invalid inputs (non-square matrices, non-list inputs).

### Minors, Cofactors, and Adjugate
- Understanding what minors and cofactors are.
- Constructing the adjugate (adjoint) matrix.
- Using these concepts to compute the inverse of a matrix.

### Inverse of a Matrix
- Methods to calculate the inverse using minors, cofactors, and adjugate.
- Conditions for invertibility and recognition of singular matrices.

### Matrix Operations
- Elementary row operations.
- Gaussian elimination and Gauss-Jordan elimination.
- Matrix multiplication and properties.

### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
- Calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors of square matrices.
- Understanding their significance in linear transformations.

### Definiteness of a Matrix
- Determining if a matrix is positive definite, negative definite, semi-definite, or indefinite.
- Interpreting eigenvalues to determine definiteness.
- Applications in optimization and data analysis.
