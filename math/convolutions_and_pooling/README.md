# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Overview

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized type of deep learning architecture designed to process grid-like data, particularly images. They have revolutionized computer vision by automatically learning hierarchical feature representations from raw pixel data.

## Introduction

CNNs were inspired by the organization of the animal visual cortex. Unlike traditional neural networks that use fully connected layers, CNNs use convolution operations that preserve spatial relationships in the data. This makes them exceptionally well-suited for image recognition, object detection, and other visual tasks.

## Key Concepts

### Convolution Operation

The convolution operation is the fundamental building block of CNNs. It involves sliding a small filter (kernel) across the input image and computing dot products at each position. This operation:

- **Detects local patterns** (edges, textures, shapes)
- **Preserves spatial relationships** between pixels
- **Shares parameters** across the entire image (weight sharing)

### Filters/Kernels

Filters are small matrices (e.g., 3√ó3, 5√ó5) containing learnable weights. Each filter detects specific features:
- Early layers: simple features (edges, colors)
- Middle layers: textures and patterns
- Deep layers: complex objects and concepts

### Feature Maps

The output of applying a filter to an image is called a feature map or activation map. Each feature map represents the presence of a particular feature at different locations in the input.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Convolutional Layers

Convolutional layers apply multiple filters to extract features from the input:

```
Input ‚Üí [Convolution + Bias] ‚Üí Feature Maps
```

**Key parameters:**
- **Number of filters**: determines the depth of output
- **Kernel size**: typically 3√ó3 or 5√ó5
- **Stride**: step size when sliding the filter (usually 1)
- **Padding**: adding borders to control output dimensions
  - Valid: no padding (output shrinks)
  - Same: padding to maintain input size

### 2. Activation Functions

Non-linear activation functions are applied after convolution:

- **ReLU** (Rectified Linear Unit): `f(x) = max(0, x)`
  - Most common choice
  - Prevents vanishing gradients
  - Computationally efficient
- **Leaky ReLU**: `f(x) = max(0.01x, x)`
- **Tanh, Sigmoid**: less common in modern architectures

### 3. Pooling Layers

Pooling reduces spatial dimensions while retaining important information:

**Max Pooling**: Takes the maximum value in each window
- Provides translation invariance
- Reduces computational load
- Typical size: 2√ó2 with stride 2

**Average Pooling**: Computes the average value in each window
- Smoother downsampling
- Less commonly used than max pooling

### 4. Fully Connected Layers

Near the end of the network, fully connected layers:
- Flatten the feature maps into a vector
- Perform high-level reasoning
- Output final predictions

### 5. Dropout

Regularization technique that randomly deactivates neurons during training:
- Prevents overfitting
- Typically rate: 0.5 (50% dropout)
- Only applied during training

## How CNNs Work

### Forward Pass

1. **Input**: Raw image (e.g., 224√ó224√ó3 RGB image)
2. **Convolution**: Extract low-level features (edges, colors)
3. **Activation**: Apply non-linearity (ReLU)
4. **Pooling**: Reduce spatial dimensions
5. **Repeat**: Multiple conv-activation-pooling blocks
6. **Flatten**: Convert to 1D vector
7. **Fully Connected**: High-level reasoning
8. **Output**: Class probabilities (softmax)

### Learning Process

CNNs learn through backpropagation:

1. **Forward pass**: Compute predictions
2. **Calculate loss**: Compare predictions to ground truth
3. **Backward pass**: Compute gradients using chain rule
4. **Update weights**: Optimize using gradient descent (Adam, SGD)

The network learns to automatically extract relevant features for the task, from simple to complex.

model = Sequential([
    # First convolutional block
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    
    # Second convolutional block
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    
    # Third convolutional block
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    
    # Fully connected layers
    Flatten(),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5),
